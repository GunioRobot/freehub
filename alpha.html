<h3>6/9/2008 Release Notes</h3>

<p>All data as of Sat June 7 is in this new system. Because this system tracks information in more detail 
  than the old you will see some unintuitive things. For example, we don't have historic membership information 
  so only the current membership is shown for a person. So we don't know "member since" for anyone. 
  Moving forward we will keep historic membership information.</p>

<p>The primary features of this release are focused around signing people in including many enhancements to Freehub v1 including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>better name matching</li>
  <li>see person summary when you find them</li>
  <li>streamlined sign in process</li>
  <li>maintain history of past memberships</li>
  <li>track digging rights/EAB and classes for members</li>
  <li>friendly design (thanks, Arena)</li>
  <li>basic reports and user-friendly export</li>
  <li>correct time zone handling</li>
</ul>
