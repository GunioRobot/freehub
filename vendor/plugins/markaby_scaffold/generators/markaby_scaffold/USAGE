Description:
    This plugin is replicates the base Rails scaffolding but produces views in Markaby instead of ERB.
    It creates a MarkabyHelper class as a starting point for writing your own Markaby helpers.
    It also monkey patches Rails 2.0.2 to fix an error specific to Markaby and Rails 2.0.2.
    Requires that Markaby plugin is installed.

Examples:
    `./script/generate markaby_scaffold post` # no attributes, view will be anemic
    `./script/generate markaby_scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean`
    `./script/generate markaby_scaffold purchase order_id:integer amount:decimal`
